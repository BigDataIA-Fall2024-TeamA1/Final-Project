# Proposed Architecture

## 1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing

### Source: CourtListener
- Use the CourtListener API or scrape legal documents and metadata, such as:
  - Case title, court, date, case description, and outcomes.

### Preprocessing
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove irrelevant text, legal jargon, or formatting issues.
- **Metadata Extraction**:
  - Extract key fields like dates, parties involved, case type, legal citations, and outcomes.
- **Embedding Generation**:
  - Convert case descriptions and legal text into vector embeddings using pre-trained models such as:
    - `text-embedding-ada-002` (OpenAI)
    - `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (HuggingFace)
- **Fraud Labeling**:
  - If labeled data is available, add flags for fraudulent cases or disputes as metadata.

### ETL Pipeline
- Automate the ingestion process with **Apache Airflow** to periodically fetch and preprocess data.
- Store raw data in **Snowflake** or a similar data warehouse for historical tracking.

---

## 2. Pinecone Vector Database

### Index Setup
- Store embeddings in **Pinecone**, indexed by metadata such as:
  - Case title, court, and year.
  - Fraud likelihood (if labeled).
  - Dispute type (e.g., coverage, liability, etc.).

### Similarity Search
- Use Pinecone to retrieve similar cases based on input embeddings.
- Example: Find past fraud-related cases that match the description of a new claim.

## 3. Multi-Agent System with LangGraph

### Agent Design
Design agents to handle specific tasks using **LangGraph** for coordination. These agents dynamically interact based on user queries.

#### Key Agents
1. **Data Retrieval Agent**:
   - Queries Pinecone to find relevant cases.
   - Filters results based on metadata (e.g., fraud flags, court type).

2. **Fraud Analysis Agent**:
   - Uses an **LLM** to analyze case descriptions for red flags.
   - Example prompt:  
     `"Does this text suggest potential fraud? Why or why not?"`
   - Outputs a fraud likelihood score with an explanation.

3. **Dispute Categorization Agent**:
   - Categorizes cases into predefined dispute types (e.g., coverage disputes, liability disputes).
   - Suggests relevant precedents.

4. **Summarization Agent**:
   - Uses an LLM to summarize retrieved cases for easier understanding.
   - Example prompt:  
     `"Summarize this legal case in less than 200 words, focusing on the main legal issues and outcome."`

5. **Recommendation Agent**:
   - Suggests actionable next steps for the user.
   - Example:  
     `"Based on similar cases, the dispute can likely be resolved by referencing [Policy Clause X]."`

6. **Legal Chatbot Agent**:
   - Provides a conversational interface for users to dynamically ask questions or refine searches.

### LangGraph Coordination
- Handles task chaining and parallelization:
  - Example:  
    `Query → Similarity Search (Data Retrieval Agent) → Fraud Detection Agent → Summarization Agent → Recommendation Agent`

---

## 4. Backend and Frontend

### Backend
- **FastAPI**:
  - Acts as the API layer connecting the agents, Pinecone, and the front-end.
  - Handles:
    - Querying Pinecone.
    - Invoking LangChain/LLM pipelines.
    - Processing metadata filters (e.g., fraud or dispute flags).

### Frontend
- **Streamlit**:
  - Interactive dashboard where users can:
    - Search for cases.
    - Upload documents to analyze fraud risk or dispute categorization.
    - View summaries and recommendations.

---

## 5. Fraud Detection System

### Model Training
- Train a **Fraud Classification Model**:
  - Use labeled fraud cases from CourtListener or synthetic datasets.
  - Features:
    - **Textual Patterns**:
      - Vagueness, over-assertion, or contradictory language in case descriptions.
    - **Metadata Anomalies**:
      - Repeated claims from the same policyholder, inconsistent dates, or unrealistic damage amounts.
  - Use libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, or **PyTorch**.

### LLM-Powered Analysis
- Fine-tuned **LLM**:
  - Use domain-specific prompts for fraud detection.
  - Example prompt:  
    `"Analyze the following claim description and identify potential signs of fraud. Provide reasoning."`
  - Incorporate the LLM as an additional layer for contextual fraud analysis.

### Pinecone Integration
- Store fraud-related embeddings in Pinecone for retrieval and similarity search.
- Use embeddings to find similar flagged cases and compare patterns.

---

## 6. Dispute Analysis

### Case Categorization
- Train an ML model or use zero-shot classification with **LLMs** to categorize disputes (e.g., liability disputes, policy misinterpretations).
- Add dispute categories as metadata in Pinecone.

### Outcome Prediction
- Use past case outcomes (e.g., resolved, dismissed) to predict the likelihood of success for new disputes.
- Train an ML model with case metadata and textual features.

### Document Comparison
- Use LLMs to compare uploaded claim documents against court precedents.
- Example:  
  `"Does this claim align with similar successful cases?"`

---

## 7. Example Query Flow

1. **User Action**:
   - A user uploads a claim document or types a query:  
     `"Is this claim fraudulent?"`

2. **Pipeline Execution**:
   - Data Retrieval Agent queries Pinecone for similar cases.
   - Fraud Analysis Agent evaluates the uploaded document and retrieved cases.
   - Summarization Agent condenses findings.
   - Recommendation Agent provides next steps.

3. **Output**:
   - The user sees:
     - Fraud likelihood score.
     - Similar cases with summaries.
     - Recommended actions.
